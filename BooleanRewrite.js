// In this series we're going to see common redundancies and superfluities that make our code unnecessarily complicated and less readable, and we're going to learn how to avoid them.

// In line with the spirit of the series, we can summarize the general rules of minimalist code in two simple principles:

// Keep your code clean and readable.
// While not violating the first principle: get rid of everything superfluous.
// In order to achieve this you should:

// Deepen your knowledge of logics.
// Deepen your understanding of the particular language you're coding with.
